About Python-OOXML
==================

Python-OOXML is a Python library for parsing Office Open XML (Microsoft Word .docx) files. At the moment it only supports HTML as the output format. Strong emphasis is put on easy customization of the output.

The library comes with an importer which is capable of splitting a document into separate chapters. It works both with documents which use Word styles, and documents where they are not used.

Python-OOXML is used in `Booktype <https://github.com/booktype/Booktype/>`_ to import and convert Word documents.
